Hello,

This is a simple Warhammer 40K Troops battle simulator for Chaos Daemons.

I did this for my final project for my Java I class.  Becuase of that there are no Objects used
and there is no option for special rules.

The text files do need to be in the same folder as the .java file or java will not be able to find the text files.
